ðŸŒˆRainbowCubeðŸŒˆ is a project where we make our first 3D game with raycasting! <br> <br>
If you are looking for inspiration/help for your own cub3d, specifically the raycaster/texture part, feel free to take a look at the `cub3d.h` header! <br>
We used the [42Docs tutorial](https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html) for the raycasting. However, we changed the variable names to make it more understandable for us, and for better structure. In the `cub3d.h` header, it is noted which variables are which to be able to connect our version to the tutorial. <br>
We have some minor changes, which are usually noted on top of the functions they're in. Completely selfmade are:
- left-right movement (which is not implemented in the tutorial)
- texture-pixel-putting (see function `tex_rgba()`)
- also the movement is restructured into multiple functions, but still works the same as in the tutorial <br> <br>

if you need some personal help with it, you can also contact me, `@shaas` on 42 Slack :) <br>
Happy codingðŸŒˆ
